This repo contains the source code for an unofficial Griffith Med Calendar.
It is a NextJS application which pulls data from Microsoft Outlook 365 ICS and does transformation before displaying on a webpage.
Additional functionality allows selection of "Pathways" depending on user preference and exposing a custom ICS link so that the user can subscribe to the events.
Support for "Gold Coast" and "Sunshine Coast" region selection.
