## Griffith Med Calendar

This repo contains the source code for an unofficial Griffith Med Calendar.
It is a NextJS application which pulls data from Microsoft Outlook 365 ICS and does transformation before displaying on a webpage.
Additional functionality will allow selection of "Pathways" depending on user preference and exposing a custom ICS link so that the user can subscribe to the events.

TODO:

- Either on server-side or client-side make the events prettier by removing underscores and replacing with spaces
